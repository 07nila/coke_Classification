# 🥤 Coke Can Detection and Counting System using YOLOv8

This repository documents a real-time AI-powered system to detect, classify, and count **Coca-Cola cans** on a conveyor belt using **YOLOv8** and **AI vision**, inspired by an industrial internship.

## 🚀 Project Overview
- Detect and differentiate between **Original** and **Diet Coke** cans
- Use **YOLOv8** model for object detection and classification
- Track moving cans on a **conveyor belt powered by a 12V DC geared motor**
- Leverage real-time webcam input and AI inference for accurate counting

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **YOLOv8** (via Roboflow)
- **Google Colab** for training
- **VS Code** for deployment and testing
- **Webcam** for real-time video capture
- **Roboflow** for dataset preparation

## ⚙️ Hardware
- 12V Geared Motor (60 RPM) driven conveyor
- Built-in or external webcam positioned above the conveyor

## 🎯 Motivation
Inspired by an internship at **Intech Systems** (10 June – 10 July 2024), an automation-focused company. Learned about **PLCs** and **AI vision technology**, and proposed this project for applications in food and beverage industries where accurate counting and classification is essential.
